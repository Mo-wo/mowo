          My name is Onyemowo Akwubo (aka Mowo). I am a software developer
          specialised in a range of frontend technologies which includes React,
          React Native, TypeScript, Next.js, and Material-UI. With a focus on
          delivering exceptional user experiences, I prioritise cross-browser
          compatibility and employ a mobile-first approach to ensure responsive
          designs. 
          
          But hey, it's not just about the code! In addition to my technical expertise, I uphold core values
          of integrity, honesty, and teamwork. I thrive in collaborative
          environments, building positive relationships with colleagues and
          stakeholders to drive successful projects. Beyond my professional
          commitments, I actively engage with developer communities through
          volunteering, demonstrating my dedication to continuous growth and community buildng . 
          
          Outside of work, I enjoy experimenting with various cuisines. I can
          cook up a storm and eat it too ðŸ¤­. I am an adventurous soul, always
          eager to explore new places and cultures. At work or outside of it, I
          am a delightful presence. Don't just take my word for it {'-'} let's
          connect and sprinkle some fun into our life and tech journey together
